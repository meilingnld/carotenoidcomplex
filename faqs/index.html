If you don't eat the recommended 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables every day, chances are you are not getting the recommended amount of carotenoids in your daily diet. Most people only get 2-3 servings of fruits and vegetables daily and most of the top ten fruits and vegetables are poor sources of carotenoids.</p><p>

Plus, even those that do eat the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables every day are not getting the amount of carotenoids found in a serving of Carotenoid Complex.

                  <p>If you want the best antioxidant protection for your body, <a href="/stories/wholefoodadvantage/" target="_self">it would be extremely difficult to eat enough fruits and vegetables</a>. GNLD stresses that it is vital that you follow a diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables, but we also know that most of the fruits and vegetables that we do eat, like bananas and potatoes, are not good sources of carotenoids. In addition, the bioavailability of carotenoids in uncooked fruits and vegetables is extremely poor. Raw carrots are only about 5-10% bioavailable in their carotenoid content. In comparison, the carotenoids in Carotenoid Complex are up to 95% bioavailable.</p>

                  <p> All of the fish used in our products come from either the pristine waters of the North Atlantic or Pacific Oceans. </p>
                  <p> NeoLife’s stringent standards for purity, potency and consistency have long been a hallmark for our company. During the raw material selection and validation processes geographic origin of ingredients such as fish is one of many criteria used to assure NeoLife Nutritionals are the finest, safest and most effective products they can be. Our relentless commitment to outstanding quality results in products you, your family and everyone you care about can trust for a lifetime. </p>
                  <p>It has come to our attention that an issue has arisen within the media concerning where some companies get the fish used to make their omega-3 fatty acid supplements. In particular this concern relates to fishes caught in the waters off coastal Africa. You can be assured that none of the ingredients used in NeoLife omega-3 supplements are sourced from that part of the world. </p>

                  <p> The NeoLife Scientific Advisory Board looked at krill as a potential omega-3 source years ago and ultimately rejected the idea for several reasons, including potency, sustainability and environmental appropriateness. </p>
                  <p> Regarding this last (and very important) point, it's our opinion that large scale krill harvesting by humans is an environmental disaster in the making.&nbsp; Krill are naturally part of the food chain, but are not part of the human food supply.&nbsp; We do not eat them....we do eat other things that eat them...which is the natural order of the food chain that supports us and our fabulous biodiversity. When we start harvesting krill we are in effect stealing the food supply of other creatures. </p>

                  <p> You can be assured that the soy ingredients used in NeoLife nutritionals are completely safe and appropriate for human consumption. <br>
                    Soy products, considered a staple in many countries, have been safely consumed for centuries. In fact, since 1999, most experiments not only conclude that consumption of soybean products and components is not harmful, but demonstrate that soy foods provide various health benefits. Hundreds of studies have associated soy with positive effects in human health, including digestive, bone, and cardiovascular, neurological and anti-carcinogenic benefits. The benefits are so well established that several of the Key Recommendations from the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (released by the USDA and United States Department of Health and Human Services, January 2011) recommend the consumption of soy-based products as part of a healthy diet.</p>

                <div class="eventItem clearfix">
                  <p> NeoLife does not do nor cause to be done any animal testing where pain and/or suffering are involved. <br>
                    In fact, we have actively supported the development of alternative non-animal test procedures. In this vein, our own Scientific Advisory Board member Dr. Arthur Furst developed and conducted research into procedures that would allow earthworms to be substituted for lab animals in toxicity testing. </p>
                  <p> Of course, the most compelling testing is often that which is performed using human subjects. Though more difficult and expensive, whenever practical we use human volunteers; some examples include carotenoid blood level tests for Carotenoid Complex, our GR2 Control Weight Loss program and Salmon Oil Plus. <br>
                    NeoLife is a research oriented nutrition company. By its nature, research that uses animals is sometimes needed.&nbsp; For example, to determine the health and growth benefit of a nutritional supplement for pets (such as our product Pet Pals in the US), you must feed the product to a living, breathing, growing animal. </p>
                  <p> These types of “feeding studies” provide important information, such as effect of nutrients on coat, hair growth, skin condition, overall health, weight gain or loss, etc.&nbsp; These types of studies are conducted without causing the animals any pain or suffering, and in fact, if using larger animals such as dogs, would more than likely be conducted at a licensed kennel, in an atmosphere where the animals would be protected, cared for, and loved. </p>
                  <p>NeoLife and the Scientific Advisory Board have been concerned about the plight of research animals for decades.&nbsp; We have been, and remain, staunch advocates of protecting animals from such pain and suffering, and were doing so long before it became as fashionable as it is today. We also know that many people need to associate themselves with companies and products they can trust. We take the trust of our Distributors and customers concerning this issue very seriously. </p>
